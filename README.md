# What effect does residential foreclosure have on crime nearby?

## Case study: Baltimore City
### Why Baltimore?
The largest city in Maryland, Baltimore is infamous for its high crime rates, with levels of property crime and violent crime that by far exceed the national average (Fenton, 2014; FBI UCR Data, 2008-2014). Baltimore city has also been heavily impacted by the foreclosure crisis; it is the second hardest hit jurisdiction in Maryland. In 2009, most of Baltimore city was designated a foreclosure “hot spot” by the Department of Housing and Community Development. Moreover, even as foreclosure rates in most other parts of the country began to subside, foreclosures in Baltimore nearly tripled between 2012 and 2013. This increase represented the biggest annual gain among the twenty largest U.S. metropolitan areas, and Baltimore was one of only five cities that showed an increase in properties receiving default, auction and repossession notices, bucking a decline nationwide. (Perlberg & Dexheimer, 2013)

## Data and Sources
I examine point-specific foreclosure and victim-based crime data, with observations from 2008 to 2013. For the former, I utilize BNIA-JFI address-specific data for homes that entered foreclosure during the observation period. For the latter, I have compiled a comprehensive list of crimes reported in Baltimore City during that time period, combining information from the Baltimore Police Department’s Victim Based Crime Data (2011-2013) with related extracts from SpotCrime (2008-2010). Each entry is categorized as violent crime or property crime. Violent crimes include homicide, rape, robbery,and assault. Property and public order crimes include burglary, larceny, and motor vehicle theft. Total crime encompasses all reported offenses. Because property crimes occur much more frequently than violent crimes, total crime counts are highly correlated with property crime counts. Additionally, due to data irregularities, not all records could be matched to an address and subsequently geocoded; as result, approximately eight percent of reported crimes were excluded from this study.

## Methodology
I apply a fixed-effect spatial lag model to point-specific panel data on foreclosures, property crime, and violent crime in Baltimore between 2008 and 2013. I utilize a fishnet of uniform 100 x 100 meter grid cells in order to investigate the proximity effects of foreclosure data on criminal activity. The null hypothesis is that foreclosures do not impact the spatial distribution of either property crime or violent crime, while the alternative hypothesis is that higher levels of foreclosures lead to higher levels of crime in the surrounding area.
To test the potential distance decay of the effect of foreclosures on crime, I overlay my map of yearly foreclosure and criminal activity in Baltimore with a fishnet grid made up of uniform 100 x 100 meter cells. I compare the number of crimes (in each category--property and violent) that occur within a given grid cell with the number of foreclosures that occur within the same cell, and in surrounding cells (see Appendix A)1. Within this framework, the annual number of crimes that occur in each grid cell is my dependent variable.
