Foreclosure and Crime in Baltimore City (Applied Spatial Econometrics)

I apply a fixed-effect spatial lag model to point-specific panel data on foreclosures, property crime, and violent crime in Baltimore between 2008 and 2013. I utilize a fishnet of uniform 100 x 100 meter grid cells in order to investigate the proximity effects of foreclosure data on criminal activity. The null hypothesis is that foreclosures do not impact the spatial distribution of either property crime or violent crime, while the alternative hypothesis is that higher levels of foreclosures lead to higher levels of crime in the surrounding area.
